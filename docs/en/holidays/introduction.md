This document provides an overview of the Holiday Management System within the application, designed to help organizations plan and manage company holidays.

## Purpose

The system allows administrators to define and schedule various types of holidays, specifying who these holidays apply to (e.g., all employees, specific departments, or shifts). It aims to:

-   Centralize the management of company holidays.
-   Ensure consistent application of holiday policies across different employee groups.
-   Provide clear visibility of upcoming holidays to employees.
-   Integrate with other attendance management features (e.g., leave calculations).

## Key Features

-   **Holiday Definition**: Create holidays with a start and end date.
-   **Holiday Types**: Categorize holidays (e.g., Weekend, Religious Day, National Day, Unplanned, Other).
-   **Targeted Application**: Apply holidays to:
    -   All employees
    -   Specific shifts
    -   Specific departments
    -   Individual employees
-   **Remarks**: Add notes or descriptions for each holiday.
-   **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for managing holidays.

## Access and Roles

-   **Admins**: Have full control to create, view, edit, and delete all holidays.
-   **Users with `View` permission**: Can view the list of planned holidays.
-   **Users with `Manage` permission**: Can create new holiday entries, edit and delete them.

This system helps in effectively communicating and managing non-working days for the organization.
