The Employee Management System allows administrators to manage all employee-related information within the system. This includes basic personal details, attendance configurations, leave approval hierarchies, important documents, salary information, and account settings.

Key features include:

-   Comprehensive employee profiles.
-   Flexible attendance tracking options (onsite, remote, hybrid).
-   Configurable leave approval workflows.
-   Secure document storage for employee records.
-   Detailed salary and payment method management.
-   Account activation/deactivation and role assignment.
-   Resignation and termination tracking.

# Prerequisites for Employee Creation

Before you can successfully create and configure new employee records in the system, certain foundational data must be established. Ensuring these prerequisites are met will streamline the employee onboarding process and prevent errors.

## 1. Departments

Each employee must be assigned to a department. Therefore, you need to define all the departments within your organization before adding employees. This helps in organizing employees and applying department-specific policies.

**Action:** Ensure all necessary departments are created and available in the system.

## 2. Shifts

For employees whose attendance is tracked (especially those with 'On Site' attendance type), a shift must be assigned. Shifts define the working hours and days for employees. Having shifts configured beforehand allows for accurate attendance tracking and reporting.

**Action:** Create and configure all required work shifts that employees will be assigned to.

## 3. Roles

Every employee account requires a role assignment. Roles determine the permissions and access levels an employee has within the system. Defining roles in advance ensures that new employees are granted appropriate access from the start.

**Action:** Define and configure all necessary roles with their respective permissions.

By ensuring these three core elements (Departments, Shifts, and Roles) are in place, you can efficiently and accurately add new employee records to the system.
