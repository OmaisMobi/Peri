# Payroll Management System

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the entire Payroll Management System within the application. The system is designed to handle all aspects of employee compensation, from regular salary processing to one-time payments and detailed payslip generation.

## Overall Purpose

 The primary goal of the Payroll Management System is to ensure accurate, timely, and compliant compensation for all employees. It streamlines complex payroll processes, reduces manual errors, and provides transparency for both employees and administrators. Key objectives include:

*   Automating salary calculations, deductions, and tax withholdings.
*   Managing both recurring and ad-hoc payments.
*   Providing clear and accessible financial records for employees.
*   Ensuring adherence to financial regulations and company policies.
*   Facilitating efficient reporting and auditing of payroll data.

## Core Components

The Payroll Management System is comprised of several interconnected components, each serving a specific function:

*   **Regular Pay Runs**: Manages the recurring, scheduled processing of employee salaries and standard deductions.
*   **One-Time Pay Runs**: Handles special, ad-hoc payments that occur outside the regular payroll schedule.
*   **Payslips Management**: Provides access to detailed individual salary statements for employees and tools for administrators to manage and export these records.
*   **One-Time Payments**: Focuses on the individual records of payments made outside the regular cycle, allowing for detailed tracking and approval.

Each component works together to provide a complete and robust payroll solution.

# Create One-Time Payments

This section describes the process of creating new one-time payments for employees, which are payments made outside of the regular payroll schedule.

## Purpose

This page allows authorized users to initiate and configure special payments for one or more employees. It is designed for situations such as:

*   Bonuses or commissions.
*   Reimbursements.
*   Adjustments to previous payrolls.
*   Any other payment that is not part of the standard monthly payroll.

## Key Features

*   **Employee Selection**: Choose one or multiple employees for the one-time payment.
*   **Period Definition**: Specify the date range for which the payment applies.
*   **Customizable Earnings**: Add various earning components with their respective amounts.
*   **Customizable Deductions**: Add various deduction components with their respective amounts.
*   **Tax Application**: Define a tax amount that applies to each selected employee.
*   **Conflict Detection**: The system checks for overlapping one-time payments or existing regular payrolls for the selected period and employees to prevent errors.
*   **Pending Approval**: Once created, the one-time payment enters a pending approval state, requiring further action from an authorized approver.

## Access and Roles

*   **Administrators**: Have full access to create one-time payments.
*   **Users with Payroll Creation Permissions**: Can create new one-time payments.

This page ensures that all special payments are accurately recorded and processed through a controlled workflow.
