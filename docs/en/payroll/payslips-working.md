# How Payslips Work

This document details the operational aspects of the Payslips Management System, from viewing individual payslips to exporting and bulk downloading payroll data.

## 1. Overview of Payslip Records

Payslip records are displayed in a table format, organized by payroll period.

### Table Columns:

*   **Employee**: The name of the employee.
*   **Department**: The department the employee is assigned to.
*   **Shift**: The shift the employee is assigned to.
*   **Tax**: The calculated tax for the payroll period, formatted with the appropriate currency symbol.
*   **Net Pay**: The net payable salary for the payroll period, formatted with the appropriate currency symbol.

### Grouping:

*   Payslips are automatically grouped by `Period` (e.g., "July 2025"), making it easy to navigate through different payroll cycles.

### Filtering:

*   **Period**: Filter payslips by a specific month and year.
*   **Employee**: Search and filter payslips for a particular employee.
*   **Department**: Filter payslips by department.

## 2. Actions on Payslip Records

Various actions can be performed on payslip records, depending on your permissions.

## 4. Bulk Downloading Payslips

Administrators and users with payroll record management or approval permissions can download multiple payslips at once.
