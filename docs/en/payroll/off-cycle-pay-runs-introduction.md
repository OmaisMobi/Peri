# One-Time Pay Runs Management

This section provides an overview of the system for managing one-time or off-cycle payroll runs. These are typically used for special payments outside of the regular payroll schedule.

## Purpose

This system allows for the processing and management of payrolls that occur outside the standard recurring pay cycles. It provides tools to:

-   Track and manage special payroll disbursements.
-   Oversee the approval process for these unique pay runs.
-   Ensure accurate financial records for all employee payments, regardless of schedule.

## Key Features

-   **Period Overview**: Clearly displays the month and year for which the one-time pay run is conducted.
-   **Employee Count**: Shows the number of employees included in each specific one-time pay run.
-   **Total Net Pay**: Summarizes the total amount disbursed across all employees in a given one-time pay run.
-   **Status Tracking**: Each pay run progresses through distinct statuses (e.g., Pending Approval, Approved, Rejected).
-   **Approval Workflow**: Facilitates the approval or rejection of pay runs, with reasons for rejection.
-   **Payment Recording**: Allows marking pay runs as paid with a specific payment date.

## Access and Roles

-   **Administrators**: Have comprehensive access to view, manage, approve, reject, and mark as paid all one-time pay runs.
-   **Users with Payroll Approval Permissions**: Can approve or reject one-time pay runs.
-   **Users with Payroll Record Management Permissions**: Can view and manage the details of one-time pay runs.

This system ensures that all special payroll events are handled efficiently and transparently.
