# Payroll Management System

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the entire Payroll Management System within the application. The system is designed to handle all aspects of employee compensation, from regular salary processing to one-time payments and detailed payslip generation.

## Overall Purpose

 The primary goal of the Payroll Management System is to ensure accurate, timely, and compliant compensation for all employees. It streamlines complex payroll processes, reduces manual errors, and provides transparency for both employees and administrators. Key objectives include:

*   Automating salary calculations, deductions, and tax withholdings.
*   Managing both recurring and ad-hoc payments.
*   Providing clear and accessible financial records for employees.
*   Ensuring adherence to financial regulations and company policies.
*   Facilitating efficient reporting and auditing of payroll data.

## Core Components

The Payroll Management System is comprised of several interconnected components, each serving a specific function:

*   **Regular Pay Runs**: Manages the recurring, scheduled processing of employee salaries and standard deductions.
*   **One-Time Pay Runs**: Handles special, ad-hoc payments that occur outside the regular payroll schedule.
*   **Payslips Management**: Provides access to detailed individual salary statements for employees and tools for administrators to manage and export these records.
*   **One-Time Payments**: Focuses on the individual records of payments made outside the regular cycle, allowing for detailed tracking and approval.

Each component works together to provide a complete and robust payroll solution.

# One-Time Payments Management

This section provides an overview of the system for managing individual one-time payments or off-cycle payroll records. These records represent specific payments made to employees outside of the regular payroll cycle.

## Purpose

This system allows for the detailed tracking and management of individual one-time payments. It provides tools to:

*   View specific payment details for employees.
*   Manage the approval or rejection of these individual payments.
*   Maintain a clear history of all one-time financial disbursements.

## Key Features

*   **Employee-Specific Records**: Focuses on individual payment records rather than entire pay runs.
*   **Detailed Financial Breakdown**: Shows earnings, deductions, and net pay for each record.
*   **Status Tracking**: Each payment record has a clear status (Pending Approval, Approved, Rejected).
*   **Approval/Rejection Workflow**: Facilitates the approval or rejection of individual payments, with reasons for rejection.
*   **Payslip View**: Allows viewing a detailed payslip for each approved payment.

## Access and Roles

*   **Administrators**: Have comprehensive access to view, approve, reject, and delete all one-time payment records.
*   **Users with Payroll Approval Permissions**: Can approve or reject one-time payment records.
*   **Users with Payroll Record Management Permissions**: Can view and manage the details of one-time payment records.
*   **Employees (Users with Payroll View Records Permissions)**: Can view their own approved one-time payment records.

This system ensures precise management and transparency for all individual one-time payments.
