# Payroll Management System

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the entire Payroll Management System within the application. The system is designed to handle all aspects of employee compensation, from regular salary processing to one-time payments and detailed payslip generation.

## Overall Purpose

 The primary goal of the Payroll Management System is to ensure accurate, timely, and compliant compensation for all employees. It streamlines complex payroll processes, reduces manual errors, and provides transparency for both employees and administrators. Key objectives include:

*   Managing both recurring and ad-hoc payments.
*   Providing clear and accessible financial records for employees.
*   Ensuring adherence to financial regulations and company policies.
*   Facilitating efficient reporting and auditing of payroll data.

## Core Components

The Payroll Management System is comprised of several interconnected components, each serving a specific function:

*   **Regular Pay Runs**: Manages the recurring, scheduled processing of employee salaries and standard deductions.
*   **One-Time Pay Runs**: Handles special, ad-hoc payments that occur outside the regular payroll schedule.
*   **Payslips Management**: Provides access to detailed individual salary statements for employees and tools for administrators to manage and export these records.
*   **One-Time Payments**: Focuses on the individual records of payments made outside the regular cycle, allowing for detailed tracking and approval.

Each component works together to provide a complete and robust payroll solution.
