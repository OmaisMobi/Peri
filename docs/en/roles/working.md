## Creating and Editing a Role

When you create or edit a role, you are presented with a form that allows you to define the role's name and its associated permissions.

-   **Role Name:** A unique name for the role. The name "Admin" is reserved and cannot be used.

### Permissions

Permissions are grouped by functionality (e.g., Users, Roles, Settings). Each group contains a list of specific actions that can be performed.

-   **Bulk Toggle:** You can use the "Toggle All" checkbox to select or deselect all permissions within a group.
-   **Individual Permissions:** You can also select permissions individually to grant specific access rights.

### Assigning Employees

You can assign a role to employees in two ways:

1.  **All Employees:** The role is automatically assigned to all existing and future employees.
2.  **Select Employee(s):** You can manually select one or more employees to assign the role to.

## Viewing Roles

The roles are displayed in a table format with the following columns:

-   **Role Name:** The name of the role.
-   **Permissions:** A list of permissions associated with the role.

## Actions

You can perform the following actions on each role (except for the "Admin" role):

-   **Edit:** Modify the role's name, permissions, and user assignments.
-   **Delete:** Remove the role from the system.

## Access Control

The visibility of the Roles & Permissions module and the ability to perform actions (create, edit, delete) are controlled by specific permissions. Only users with the appropriate permissions or the "Admin" role can manage roles and permissions.
