# Biometric Management System

This document provides an overview of the Biometric Management System within the application, designed to manage requests for biometric attendance adjustments.

## Purpose

The system allows employees to submit requests to adjust their biometric attendance records, typically for situations where they forgot to check in/out, experienced technical issues, or were on official business. It aims to:

-   Provide a formal process for correcting attendance records.
-   Streamline the approval workflow for biometric adjustments.
-   Maintain an auditable log of all biometric requests and their statuses.

## Key Features

-   **Biometric Request Submission**: Employees can submit requests for specific periods (Morning, Break Start, Break End, Evening) with a reason.
-   **Predefined Reasons**: Offers a list of common reasons for convenience, with the option to enter a custom reason.
-   **Approval Workflow**: Requests go through an approval process, typically involving administrators or users with specific permissions.
-   **Status Tracking**: Each request has a clear status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
-   **Rejection Reasons**: If a request is rejected, a reason can be provided.
-   **Access Control**: Permissions are managed to control who can view, create, edit, and delete biometric requests.

## Access and Roles

-   **Employees**: Can submit new biometric requests and view the status of their own requests.
-   **Admins**: Have full oversight and management capabilities over all biometric requests, including approval and rejection.
-   **Assigned Users (Managers/Supervisors)**: Can view and manage biometric requests for their assigned team members.
-   **Users with `Approve` permission**: Can approve or reject biometric requests.
-   **Users with `Create Request` permission**: Can create new biometric requests.
-   **Users with `View` permission**: Can view biometric requests.

This system ensures a controlled and transparent process for managing biometric attendance adjustments.
