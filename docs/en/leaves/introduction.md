# Leave Management System

This document provides an overview of the Leave Management System within the application, designed to streamline the process of requesting, tracking, and approving employee leaves.

## Purpose

The system allows employees to submit various types of leave requests (e.g., regular, half-day, short leave) and provides a structured workflow for their approval by designated approvers. It aims to:

-   Simplify the leave application process for employees.
-   Provide clear visibility into leave balances and history.
-   Automate the approval hierarchy based on defined roles.
-   Ensure compliance with company leave policies.

## Key Features

-   **Multiple Leave Types**: Support for regular, half-day, and short leaves.
-   **Dynamic Leave Balances**: Real-time tracking of paid leave balances based on configured leave types and durations (monthly, quarterly, annually).
-   **Approval Workflow**: Multi-level approval hierarchy with roles (recommender, approver).
-   **Cancellation Requests**: Ability to request cancellation of approved leaves with a separate approval process.
-   **Historical Tracking**: Comprehensive log of all leave requests, their statuses, and approval actions.
-   **Document Upload**: Option to attach supporting documents to leave requests.

## Access and Roles

-   **Employees**: Can submit new leave requests, view their leave history, and check their leave balances.
-   **Admins**: Have full oversight and management capabilities over all leave requests and configurations.
-   **Assigned Users (Managers/Supervisors)**: Can view and manage leave requests for their assigned team members.
-   **Approvers/Recommenders**: Participate in the multi-level approval process, either recommending or approving leave requests based on their assigned role and level in the hierarchy.

This system ensures a transparent and efficient leave management process for all users.
