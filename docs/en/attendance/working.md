This guide explains how to effectively use the Attendance Management System.

## Viewing Attendance Records

1.  Navigate to the **Attendance** section under the **Attendance Management** group in the client panel.
2.  The main page displays a table of attendance records.

## Filtering Attendance Data

To refine the attendance data displayed, you can use the available filters:

-   **Date Range**: Select a start and end date to view attendance within a specific period.
-   **Employee**: Filter records for a specific employee.
-   **Attendance Type**: Narrow down by attendance type (e.g., Onsite, Remote, Hybrid).
-   **Department**: View attendance for employees belonging to a particular department.
-   **Shift**: Filter by assigned work shifts.

## Exporting Attendance Data

To export the attendance data for further analysis or record-keeping:

1.  Apply any desired filters to narrow down the data you wish to export.
2.  Click on the **"Export Attendance"** button, usually located in the header actions section.
3.  The system will generate an Excel file (`attendance_table.xlsx`) containing the filtered attendance data, which will be downloaded to your device.
4.  The export function downloads only the data currently displayed in the attendance table. To ensure all employee records are included in the export, you may need to adjust the table's display settings, such as increasing per page records pagination.

## Understanding Attendance Data

The exported attendance report typically includes:

-   Employee details.
-   Daily attendance status (e.g., Present, Absent, Late).
-   In and out times.
-   Total working hours.
-   Any remarks or policy violations.

## Viewing Individual Employee Reports

To view a detailed annual report for a specific employee, including their leave balance:

1.  From the attendance table, click on the name of the employee whose report you wish to view.
2.  This action will navigate you to a dedicated report page for that employee.
3.  On this page, you will find a comprehensive overview of their attendance throughout the year, along with a detailed breakdown of their leave balances (used vs. remaining) for various leave types.
