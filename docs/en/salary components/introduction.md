The Salary Components feature allows administrators to define and manage various elements that make up an employee's salary, such as earnings and deductions. This ensures accurate payroll processing and clear payslip generation.

Key functionalities include:

-   **Customizable Components:** Create and manage two types of salary components (e.g., earnings and deductions).
-   **Flexible Calculation Types:** Define components as fixed amounts or percentages of the base salary.
-   **Tax Status:** Mark earning components as taxable or non-taxable.
-   **One-Time Deductions:** Identify deductions that apply only once.
-   **Payslip Integration:** Components are clearly displayed on employee payslips.
-   **Payroll Restrictions:** Prevent modifications to salary components when a payroll is in process to maintain data integrity.
