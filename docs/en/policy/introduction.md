The Attendance Policies feature allows administrators to define and manage various rules related to employee attendance. These policies help in automating attendance tracking, ensuring compliance, and providing a fair system for managing employee work hours and leaves.

Key functionalities include:

-   **Late Minutes Policy:** Configure how late arrivals and early departures are handled.
-   **Single Biometric Policy:** Define actions for instances where only one biometric punch is recorded for a day.
-   **Grace Minutes Policy:** Set up grace periods for employee arrivals.
-   **Overtime Policy:** Establish rules for calculating and limiting overtime.
-   **Sandwich Leave Policy:** Manage how leaves are treated when taken around official off days.

These policies provide flexibility in managing attendance, allowing organizations to tailor the system to their specific needs and regulations.
