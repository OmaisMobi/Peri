The Notice Board is a powerful tool for administrators to create and display announcements and important information to users. It allows you to share updates, news, or any other message in a structured and visually appealing way.

Key features include:

-   Creating notices with a title and content.
-   Supporting different content types: rich text, file attachments (PDFs, images), and external links.
-   Customizing the appearance of notices with background, icon, and text colors.
-   Setting notices as active or inactive.
-   Allowing users to dismiss notices.
-   Role-based access control for managing notices.
