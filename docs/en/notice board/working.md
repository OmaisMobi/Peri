This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the Notice Board feature.

## Creating a Notice

1.  Navigate to the **Notice Board** section in the client panel.
2.  Click on the **"+ Add"** button.
3.  Fill in the **Notice Title**.
4.  Choose a **Content Type**:
    -   **Add Text**: A rich text editor will appear, allowing you to compose your message directly.
    -   **Attach File**: You can upload a PDF or an image file.
    -   **Attach URL**: You can provide a link to an external webpage.
5.  Customize the notice's appearance by selecting a **Background Color**, **Icon Color**, and **Text Color**.
6.  Under **Options**, you can check the **"Can Be Closed By User"** box if you want to allow users to dismiss the notice.
7.  Use the **"Is Active"** toggle to control the visibility of the notice. If it's on, the notice will be displayed to users.
8.  Click **"Create"** to save the notice.

## Managing Notices

On the Notice Board page, you will see a list of all created notices. You can:

-   **Edit** a notice by clicking the edit icon.
-   **Delete** a notice by clicking the delete icon. If the notice has a file attached, the file will also be deleted.
-   **Activate/Deactivate** a notice directly from the list using the toggle under the "Active" column.
-   **View** the full details of a notice by clicking the view icon. Even if a user dismisses the notice, they can still access its details here as long as the notice remains active.

## Viewing Notices

Active notices will be displayed to the relevant users. Depending on the content type, users will see:

-   The formatted text.
-   A link to the attached file.
-   The URL to the external page.
